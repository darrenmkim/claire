## Derivative Solution for Valuation & Accounting - superseded by "elenent"
* Calculates valuations of derivative instruments (options, futures, swaps, and more) based on a mathematical approach on transactional data.
* This project "claire" was using PostgreSQL. But due to the fastly-changing nature of derivative contracts, the project moved on to graph/document-based database, Crux, in project repository "elenent". This repository is archived in that regard.
